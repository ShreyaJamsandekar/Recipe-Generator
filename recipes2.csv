You\'ll need to scrunch/pleat to fit which creates the signature rustic sides! The batter will weigh it down so don\'t worry if it doesn\'t stay in.Beat the cream cheese in a large bowl on medium speed for 2 minutes, scraping down the sides as needed, until smooth and lump-free. Add sugar and beat on low speed for 10 seconds.Flour & cream (Note 6) – Put about 1/4 of the cream and all the flour in a medium bowl. Hand whisk until lump free (it will be paste-like), then slowly pour in the remaining cream while whisking. Once flour is incorporated, whisk in vanilla. (PS not making whipped cream here! Should be pourable)Slowly pour the cream into the cream cheese bowl with the beater going on low. Beat just until combined. Then slowly pour the eggs in while the beater is still on low speed. As soon as the eggs are incorporated, stop beating to minimise getting bubbles in the batter (Note 7).Remove air bubbles – Pour into the prepared pan. Bang the pan on the counter then pop bubbles that rise to the surface with a small sharp knife. I do repeat 3 to 5 times. (Note 7)Bake 45 minutes or until the surface is a deep golden brown. It can take up to 65 minutes and that\'s fine! (Seriously, read Note 8) Keep a close eye on it for the last 15 minutes, you want it deeply golden but not burnt. The centre will still be wobbly and the cake will rise like a soufflé.Chill overnight – Cool in the cake pan for at least 2 hours on the counter (it will sink, that\'s normal). Then refrigerate for a minimum of 8 hours, uncovered. Serving – Release the sides of the springform pan. Hold excess paper overhang to lift off base onto a cutting board or plate. Fold down sides – I love serving it on the paper, it\'s part of the visuals! Bring to room temp for 30 minutes if time permits, though also great served chilled. Cut like cake!

(Note 3)Start the timer once all the eggs are in. – Dippy solders: 3 minutes (can\'t peel)– Runny yolks: 6 minutes– Soft boiled: 8 minutes– Hard boiled: 10 minutesCool 10 minutes – Remove eggs using a slotted spoon into a large bowl or sink filled with plenty of cold tap water to cool the eggs. (Ice – Note 4) Cool 10 minutes.Peel from base in water – Crack the base of the shell by tapping it on the counter, then peel under water from the base (it\'s easier).Storing – Hard boiled eggs can be stored in the fridge for up to 7 days (peeled or unpeeled).

If you have less than 2 litres / quarts, top up with water.Fill jars/containers: Measure out into containers for storage and faster cooling.

Add potato. Bring it back up to the boil, then cook for 5 minutes or until just soft. Keep an eye on them – sliced potatoes cook quickly, and if they overcook they will break when tossing.Drain and marinate: Drain potatoes, then transfer them to a bowl. Handle gently – the shape of these potatoes make them prone to breaking while hot (they're firmer when cool). Pour over 3/4 of the dressing, add eschalots and toss very gently. Set aside to marinate for 30 minutes.Cook bacon: Place bacon in a cold non-stick pan then turn the stove to medium high. As the pan heats, the bacon fat will melt so there's no need for oil! Cook bacon, stirring constantly (to avoid spitting!), until golden or to your taste. Drain on paper towels.Cook corn: Meanwhile, cook corn cob using one of these methods. Either grill on the BBQ (10 min on high) or directly over the gas flame on your stove (6 min, direct contact with flame), until nicely charred and corn is cooked. Otherwise, cut the corn off the kernels then pan fry on high heat in residual bacon fat or 1 tbsp olive oil until charred.Cut off kernels: Cut kernels off cob, trying to keep of the kernels in clumps (looks nice!). (Note 4 for my method)Make salad: To the same bowl, add all the corn, half the bacon and most of the green onion. Toss gently, then transfer to serving bowl.

Cool on the counter for 2 hours until it reaches 30°C/86°F. See Note 9 for overnight refrigeration.Second straining: Just before pouring over the cake, strain the glaze into a jug.

For the most perfect surface, try to do it in one motion without breaking the pour. Pour with confidence in a thick stream rather than a thin drizzle (which might set too quick and leave drips).Ensure all sides are fully coated – if not, quickly do a little pour down the sides to coat the naked patches.Transfer cake to platter: Before the mirror glaze sets (takes ~10 minutes), move the cake to a cake platter (Note 9 again for my cake-shifting method).Fix blemishes – Use excess glaze on the tray and in the jug to fill gaps and tears.

World’s Easiest Yeast Bread recipe –...,"['▢ 3 cups (450g) flour , bread or plain/all purpose (Note 1)▢ 2 tsp instant or rapid rise yeast (Note 2 for normal / active dry yeast)▢ 2 tsp cooking / kosher salt , NOT table salt  (Note 3)▢ 1 1/2 cups (375 ml)  very warm tap water , NOT boiling or super hot (ie up to 55°C/130°F) (Note 4)', 'Dough shaping▢ 1 1/2 tbsp flour , for dusting']",5,"['Mix Dough: Mix flour, yeast and salt in a large bowl. Add water, then use the handle of a wooden spoon to mix until all the flour is incorporated. Dough will be wet and sloppy – not kneadable, but not runny like cake batter. Adjust with more water or flour if needed for right consistency (see video at 17 sec, Note 5). Rise: Cover with cling wrap or plate, leave on counter for 2 – 3 hours until it doubles in volume, it’s wobbly like jelly and the top is bubbly (see video at 24 seconds). If after 1 hour it doesn’t seem to be rising, move it somewhere warmer (Note 6).Optional – refrigerate for flavour development (Note 9): At this stage, you can either bake immediately (move onto Step 5) or refrigerate for up to 3 days.Take chill out of refrigerated dough – if you refrigerated dough per above, leave the bowl on the counter for 45 – 60 minutes while the oven is preheating. Cold dough does not rise as well.Preheat oven (Note 7) – Put dutch oven in oven with lid on (26cm/10"" or larger). Preheat to 230°C/450°F (220° fan) 30 minutes prior to baking. (Note 8 for no dutch oven)Shape dough: Sprinkle work surface with 1 tbsp flour, scrape dough out of bowl. Sprinkle top with 1/2 tbsp flour.Using a dough scraper or anything of similar shape (cake server, large knife, spatula), fold the sides inwards (about 6 folds) to roughly form a roundish shape. Don’t be too meticulous here – you’re about to deform it, it’s more about deflating the bubbles in the dough and forming a shape you can move.Transfer to paper: Slide a large piece of parchment/baking paper (not wax paper) next to the dough, then flip the dough upside down onto the paper (ie seam side down, smooth side up). Slide/push it towards the middle, then reshape it into a round(ish) shape. Don\'t get too hung up about shape. In fact, lopsided = more ridges = more crunchy bits!Dough in pot: Remove piping hot dutch oven from oven. Use paper to place dough into pot, place lid on.Bake 30 minutes covered, then 12 minutes uncovered or until deep golden and crispy.Cool on rack for 10 minutes before slicing.']",Western,"Bread, Sides"

The Shredded Chicken and Beef are almost as good (pork is slightly juicier) and stored similarly. The next simplest is Fish Tacos because it's very quick to cook, then just put them in a serving dish and break into chunks with fork. If you want to use one of the chicken recipes to make ahead, use boneless thigh fillets, cook, then keep whole, cover and cool, reserve every drop of leached juice. Before serving, chop/slice, cover and microwave reheat.Taco Fixings:\xa0I like to have at least one fresh thing to stuff in tacos (pickled cabbage is my choice in this Fiesta), + a sauce (the Restaurant Style Salsa,) + avocado in some form (guac or slices or in Pico de Gallo) + coriander/cilantro. Chopped white onion is very common in Mexico, and Tex Mex fans such as myself will almost always have sour cream and shredded cheese too!Other Sides:\xa0Tortillas + things to stuff in tortillas usually makes for a satisfying meal in itself, but to round things out I usually provide a salad or vegetables of some form.
